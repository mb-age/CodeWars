**7 kyu**
# 16+18=214
For this Kata you will have to forget how to add two numbers together.

The best explanation on what to do for this kata is this meme:

![248 + 208 = 4416](https://i.ibb.co/Y01rMJR/caf.png)

In simple terms, our method does not like the principle of carrying over numbers and just writes down every number it calculates :-)

You may assume both integers are positive integers
