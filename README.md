# CodeWars
Codewars is where developers achieve code mastery through challenge.

Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata. These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment. On Codewars the community and challenge progression is gamified, with users earning ranks and honor for completing kata, contributing kata, and quality solutions.

# Kyu/Dan Ranks
Each kata on the site is set to a Kyu/Dan rank, based on its subject area and difficulty. Every new user on Codewars starts being ranked as **8 Kyu** and goes downward.

What are Kyu and Dan? The terms are borrowed from a system in Japanese martial arts, which is in turn borrowed from the game of Go. Kyu indicates the number of degrees away from master level (Dan). This is why they count downward. Once you reach master level, we count upward.
